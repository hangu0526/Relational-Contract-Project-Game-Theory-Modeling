Payoff Statistics Explanation:
This table summarizes the total payoffs across three strategy categories:
1. 'Only TFT': Players who exclusively followed the Tit-for-Tat strategy throughout the game.
2. 'TFTA Consistent': Players whose behavior was largely consistent with Tit-for-Tat.
3. 'All Strategies': All other players, regardless of the strategies they followed.
Metrics include mean, standard deviation, and range of total payoffs.
